### What I learned

While developing this project, I had my first experience with using React and gained insights into various important concepts. Here are some key takeaways:

- Foundations of React and Component Structure
- Utilizing the useState Hook
- JSX and Rendering Components
- User Interaction and Event Handling
- Managing Images and Styling

During the project, I began to grasp React's foundational principles and its component-based architecture. I utilized the useState hook to dynamically manage and update component states, handling user input including ratings and feedback. Furthermore, I practiced event handling, responding to user interactions such as button clicks, and efficiently capturing user ratings and feedback submissions. Moreover, I honed my skills in presenting visual content, seamlessly integrating images into components, and proficiently managing styling using CSS. This project provided me with valuable experience in understanding React's capabilities and its role in building dynamic user interfaces.
